Code & related files for YouTube Stats Display by Prof. John Gallaugher
Uses:
- Adafruit Matrix Portal M4 - https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745
- Adafruit 64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 4mm pitch - https://www.adafruit.com/product/2278
  But any 64x32 HUB75 display "should" work.
- Any USB-c data cable

  https://www.adafruit.com/product/4631

This code also works with the Matrix Portal S3, which has more memory: https://www.adafruit.com/product/5778
If you use the S3 and you have multiple YouTube channels, you can use the "multi-channel-code.py" option. Just save this as code.py to your CIRCUITPY board.
Also configure your multiple channels with the "multi-channel-settings.toml" file, but be sure to save this as "settings.toml" to your CIRCUITPY board.

Also:
- A Wi-Fi connection
- Setup (free for level of use in this build) YouTube API v.3
- A properly configured settings.toml file the board's CIRCUITPY volume.
- The "fonts" file with fonts enclosed in this repp, also installed on the CIRCUITPY board.
